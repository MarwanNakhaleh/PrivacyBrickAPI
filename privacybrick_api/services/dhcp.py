"""AdGuard Home DHCP takeover — proxied via its local REST API.

Lets the app move DHCP duty from the user's router onto the PrivacyBrick, so
every device on the LAN automatically gets the Pi as its DNS server. The flow
is: check (is the router's DHCP still on? is the Pi's own IP static?), then
enable (pin the Pi's IP if needed, pick a lease range, turn AdGuard DHCP on),
with disable as the undo.

Pure logic (range picking, /etc/network/interfaces rewriting, route parsing)
lives in plain functions so it is unit-testable without root or AdGuard.
