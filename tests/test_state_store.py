"""StateStore is shared between the API service and the privacybrick-pair
CLI — two separate processes writing one JSON file. Each process holds its
own StateStore instance, so every instance must see writes made by the
others after it was constructed (real bug: pairing codes minted by the CLI
were invisible to the already-running API, 2026-07-28)."""
